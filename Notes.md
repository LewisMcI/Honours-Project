# Last Week Todo
- Write up an overview of polygons for the Interim report introduction, write up to 1500 words including the key points that drive the experiment.
- Work towards literature review, and hope to find the project within the research

- Read 3 abstracts per day, looking for agreements and disagreements within the community

- Look for optimizing voxels in one field, with information from your own.

- Interim report is in December, everything is pushed back three weeks

- Remember marks come from following the method, not the project.
