## Interactive Indirect Illumination Using Voxel Cone Tracing

Uses a new efficient approximate voxel cone tracing with less precomputation using sparse voxel octrees.

## Voxel Based Pathfinding with Jumping for Games

Showcases a voxel model for pathfinding allowing continuous navmesh in UE4. It is possible already in UE4 with NavLinkProxys however these links need to be defined by hand.

## Voxelization and Voxel Management in Unity

Compares various native solutions to open source programs for voxel tools within Unity3D.

## Integrating Real-Time Fluid Simulation with a Voxel Engine

Showcases the usage of Real-Time fluid simulation inside of Minecraft.

## Procedural Feature Generation for Volumetric Terrains

Uses grammar rules to procedurally generate realistic terrains, accounting for overhangs and caves.

## Fast Fluid Simulations with Sparse Volumes on the GPU

Introduces a new technique using NVIDIA's GVDB Voxel application for the simulation of tens of millions of voxels.

## Cinemacraft: exploring fidelity cues using voxel models

Looks into the link between avatar fidelity in virtual worlds, and the behavior of realism within the interaction between virtual humans. Uses various techniques on top of very simple character models to improve player immersion.

## Comparative Analysis of Real-Time Global Illumination Techniques in Current Game Engines

Compares four separate techniques used in current game engines, explains their process in detail, some of which include voxels, then showcase their own in-house model.

## Delta Global Illumination for Mixed Reality

Proposes a technique using a combination of Voxel Cone Tracing and Differential Rendering, to create global illumination in Mixed Reality. Proposes future work of adding Sparse Voxel Octrees however acknowledges lower memory usage is met with higher computational cost.  

## QuanTaichi: a compiler for quantized simulations

Suggests the usage of a new compiler, allowing for a massive decrease in memory consumption using aggressive quantization. Precision is reduced however their study suggests they are indistinguishable from full precision. Future work includes adding automatic detection for suitable quantization schemes.

# Medical
