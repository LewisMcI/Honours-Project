Uses voxelization to construct acoustic filters to create mufflers, instruments and encoding.

## [Giga Voxel Structural Design](#GigaVoxelStructuralDesign)

Uses a 1.1billion voxel object to improve structural design. Held back severely by computation time.

## [Voxel-Based 3D Facial Recognition](#VoxelBased3DFacialRecognition)

Takes occlusion-invariance to model a voxel based facial reconstruction with key feature mapping using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Discusses an implementation of NeRFs using voxels

# [A Voxel based approach to evolutionary shape optimisation](#AVoxelbasedapproachtoevolutionaryshapeoptimisation)

Applies voxel technology to shape optimisation, which is the problem of minimizing a set '*cost* ' whilst following constraints. In this case a genetic algorithm is used to create a beam between the bottom, and top half of the voxel model.
